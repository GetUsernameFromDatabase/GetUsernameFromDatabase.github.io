    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Affinity towards computer since childhood. I love programming since it
      allows me to automate tasks which are too tedious to do by hand or far too
      complex.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that in the modern age there is nothing that you can't learn -
      if the answer isn't out there then there is enough information out there
      help find a conclusion. Emphasis should be more on refining way of thought
      rather than directly on knowledge - the better a person is at learning
      then more knowledge they can amass.
